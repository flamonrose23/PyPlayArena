PyPlay Arena : The Ultimate Experience of Gaming on computer

The platform's name was inspired by the idea that our games are primarily built with Python, inviting players to immerse themselves in front of their screens. Initially, we set out to create three games, but due to unforeseen personal circumstances, one of our team members had to step down.	
Despite this setback, our remaining team was determined to bring this project to life. This is just the beginning; we have ambitious plans to expand the platform with multiple games in the future.

For our portfolio project at Holberton School, we decided to focus on two games: a Chess Game and a basic racing car game named Route Rush. We hope you enjoy your gaming experience and welcome any suggestions to improve it further!
